(note): Fixed a few things!

- Heightmap roads to access the parking
- Added grass where it was missing
- Fixed the black things above one thnnel
- Removed random rocks where there shouldn't be on small heightmap
- Fixed my stupidity again for the menu, I promise that this is the last time the menu has a problem! The problem was that instead of the parking (for "Only office & parking"), it was the warehouse...
