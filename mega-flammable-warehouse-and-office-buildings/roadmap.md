**Known issues**:
- **[IMPORTANT]**: Video projector not working (Weird issue)
- Only 1 custom road left, will probably not get fixed.
- Custom roads hard to drive on

**Coming out later**:
- Ground floor totally furnished
- Warehouse getting an office
- A special office for me because I made the map
- Cars on the parking
- Few fixed details
- Version of the buildings that can be copied to other maps easily
- Some signs for the road
- Custom tunnels for the map (will not be there that soon lol)
- Improved heightmap for the parking itself, I think it's 100% possible
