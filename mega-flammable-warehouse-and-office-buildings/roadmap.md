**Known issues**:
- **[IMPORTANT]**: Video projector not working
- A tunnel having some black things above, fix this weekend
- Some random rock things in the small heightmap where the rocky hills are for the big heightmap, going to fix this (planned to fix next update)
- Missing grass for small heightmap (planned to fix next update)
- Custom roads a bit ugly and too visible on the road (heightmap will fix this)
- Custom roads hard to drive on

**Coming out later**:
- Ground floor totally furnished
- Warehouse getting an office
- A special office for me because I made the map
- Cars on the parking
- A few fixed details
- Version of the buildings that can be copied to other maps easily
- Some signs for the road
- Custom tunnels for the map (will not be there that soon lol)
- Improved heightmap for the parking roads
- Improved heightmap for the parking itself, I think it's 100% possible
